This extended cookie policy provides a comprehensive overview of cookie practices for our website at graviah.xyz, including compliance with GDPR, CCPA, and Google's cookie consent requirements.<br> <br> <b>What are Cookies?</b><br>Cookies are small text files containing small amounts of information which are downloaded and stored on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are then sent back to the originating website on each subsequent visit or to another website that recognizes that cookie. Cookies allow websites to recognize a user’s device and remember certain information about your visit, preferences and online actions.<br>Cookies perform many different jobs that make the internet experience easier and more customized. For example, cookies are used to remember your preferences on websites you visit often, help customize web content and recommendations based on your interests, determine if traffic to a site is from a human user or bot, and provide anonymized data on how users interact with a website.<br>The main types of cookies:<br> <li>First Party Cookies - These are cookies set by the website domain being visited. They can only be read by that domain.</li> <li>Third Party Cookies - These are cookies set by domains other than the one being visited. For example, the website may partner with outside advertisers, analytics companies or social media sites to provide relevant content, advertising and plugins.</li> <li>Session Cookies - These cookies exist only during a user's online session and disappear from your device when you close your browser. They allow websites to link visitor actions that happen in the same session.</li> <li>Persistent Cookies - These cookies remain on your device between browsing sessions until they expire or are deleted. They allow preferences or actions across multiple sites to be stored.</li>The Length of Time a Cookie Stays on Your Device Depends on Whether it is a Session or Persistent Cookie and the Cookie Expiration Time.<br> <br> <b>Why We Use Cookies?</b><br>We use cookies for a variety of reasons detailed below. Cookies allow us to optimize your site experience, understand how the site is being used, provide customized content and analyze site traffic.<br>Additionally, we comply with legal obligations under GDPR, CCPA, and Google's policies regarding cookie consent. By using our site, you can opt into or out of non-essential cookies such as those used for analytics, performance tracking, and marketing.<br>We use third-party analytics services such as Google Analytics to understand how users interact with our website. These cookies track anonymized data about how visitors use the website. Google Analytics helps us improve the website's functionality. You can view Google's privacy policy here: (https://policies.google.com/privacy).<br>Marketing cookies, including those provided by Google Ads, are used to track visitors across websites to deliver targeted advertising based on your interests. These cookies will only be placed after receiving your consent. You can review Google's ad cookie usage and privacy policy here: (https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads).<br>Another types of cookies:<br> <li>Strictly Necessary Cookies:</li> <p>These essential cookies enable core website functionality and are required for the site to operate properly. For example, strictly necessary cookies allow you to access secure areas of the website. Without these strictly necessary cookies, the website cannot function properly.</p><br> <li>Preference Cookies:</li> <p>These cookies allow our website to store information that changes how the site behaves or looks based on your preferences, such as language and location preferences. They can be used to provide you with a more personalized experience.</p><br> <li>Analytics Cookies:</li> <p>Analytics cookies help website owners understand interactions with their website and how visitors use the site. These cookies gather data anonymously about how visitors use the website.</p><br> <li>Performance Cookies:</li> <p>These cookies collect information on how users interact with a website, such as which pages are visited most often. They identify areas where the user experience can be improved.</p><br> <li>Marketing Cookies:</li> <p>Marketing cookies are used to track visitors across multiple websites where ads are being served. This provides useful data to help target advertisements effectively. Marketing cookies are often placed on websites by third party advertising companies.</p><br> <li>Social Media Cookies:</li> <p>These cookies allow visitors to share content on social media platforms. Social media plugins place cookies to enable proper functioning.</p><br> <br> <b>How to Manage Cookie Preferences?</b><br>You can manage website cookie preferences through your browser settings and other tools:<br> <li>Browser Cookie Settings</li>Browser settings allow you to enable, disable and delete cookies for some or all websites. Note that blocking cookies entirely may negatively impact your browsing experience as many websites rely on cookies to properly function. Each browser handles cookie management differently, so visit the relevant help section of your browser of choice: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, Explorer.<br> <li>Cookie Consent Management Platform</li>Our website utilizes a consent management platform that allows users to opt in or out of certain cookie categories. The platform displays a banner at the bottom or top of the site that provides details about the types of cookies used and allows you to customize your preferences.<br> <li>Blocking and Deleting Cookies</li>In addition to browser cookie settings, there are utilities available to block and delete cookies:<br> <ol> <li>Ghostery allows you block/delete cookies and see who sets them.</li> <li>CCleaner deletes cookies and optimizes browsers.</li> </ol> <br> <li>Do Not Track</li>Some browsers have Do Not Track features that allow you to indicate your preference that sites do not track you. At this time, global standardization of how websites should respond to Do Not Track signals has not been established. As a result, this website is unlikely to intercept and respond to Do Not Track signals. However, other tracking prevention measures like incognito browsing mode can help.<br> <br> <b>Consent Management</b><br>Our website utilizes a consent management platform (CMP) to ensure compliance with GDPR, CCPA, and Google's cookie policies. The platform displays a banner at the bottom or top of the site that provides details about the types of cookies used and allows you to customize your preferences.<br>- Explicit Consent: Non-essential cookies, such as those for analytics, advertising, and social media, are only placed on your device after you provide explicit consent. You can opt-in to specific categories of cookies.<br>- Withdraw Consent: You can revisit your cookie preferences at any time by accessing the “Manage Cookie Settings” link on our website. This allows you to withdraw consent or modify your cookie choices.<br> <br> <b>How We Use Tracking Technologies?</b><br>We use internet tracking technologies only with appropriate consent and predominantly for performance, analytics and functionality cookies to improve your browsing experience. However, some embedded content from social media and advertising partners use tracking technologies beyond our control. Please use the available cookie consent tools to customize your preferences.<br>In addition to traditional browser cookies, we also use advanced tracking technologies in compliance with Google’s Consent Mode. This feature allows us to adjust how Google services (like Google Analytics and Google Ads) function based on the consent status of the user. For example, if you decline analytics cookies, we will ensure that any tracking is done anonymously.<br> <br> <b>Other Tracking Technologies</b><br>In addition to traditional browser cookies, other tracking technologies exist:<br> <li>Web Beacons</li>These tiny transparent graphic images (also known as pixel tags or clear gifs) can be used to track the online movements of web users. For example, web beacons can count page views, deliver cookies, detect Adobe Flash versions and more.<br> <li>ETags</li>An ETag, entity tag, is an opaque identifier used in web caching and conditional HTTP requests. ETags allow websites to determine if the version of a file stored locally matches the version on the website server. They provide efficiencies in loading cached resources but have implications for user privacy and tracking.<br> <li>Local Storage Objects (LSOs)</li>LSOs like Flash cookies are stored as data files on your device and can be used to remember settings, usage and other data specific to a site.<br> <li>Browser Fingerprinting</li>This technique uses details about your device, such as software versions and configurations, to generate a unique fingerprint which can then be used for tracking without cookies.<br> <li>Deep Packet Inspection</li>Deep Packet Inspection analyzes both header and payload information in internet traffic. This allows very detailed monitoring and tracking of internet users and their activities.<br> <li>History Sniffin</li>Some websites sneakily perform cross-site history sniffing by styling visited links differently than unvisited links. This allows them to determine your history and build profiles about your interests and behavior.<br> <li>Canvas Fingerprinting</li>The HTML canvas element can extract data about settings of your device and computer such as font preferences. This information can be used to fingerprint browsers.<br> <li>Device Recognition</li>Cross-device tracking methods like deterministic matching try to identify and link devices, enabling persistent tracking across multiple devices like desktop, mobile and tablets.<br> <li>Location Tracking</li>Geolocation capabilities in browsers and devices can allow websites to gather your location data. Location can be derived from IP address, wifi networks or GPS.<br> <br> <b>Additional Privacy Information</b><br>For more details about privacy practices, please see our full Privacy Policy.
